The goal of this web application is to help users, particularly those who have a very disorganized fridge and do not keep a good record of food expiry dates, to 
reduce food waste and prevent food poisoning.

By providing a digital space for users to store information regarding their products (e.g. expiry date, name, description), this allows users to easily track the
items in their fridge.

When items are expired, this will be shown in a brown font color with a trash icon, reminding users to dispose them immediately as eating expired food is likely to lead 
to food poisoning.

When items are about to be expired (within 3 days), items will be listed in a red color, reminding users to cook them soon to avoid waste.

Remaining items that are not due to expire anytime soon (> 3 days) are presented in a green font color.
